OpenRAVE Release Information
=====================================

Every release comes with:

* **X-src.tar.bz2** - Source code. Windows users would need the msvc_files.tgz from Subversion to use it.

* **X-win32-vcX-setup.exe** - Windows Installers compiled for VS2008 (vc90) and VS2010 (vc100). 

Files are generated and uploaded using the scripts in the **release** source folder. See `Developer's Guide <http://openrave.org/en/main/devel/releases.html>`_ for more information.

latest_stable
------------------

Files in latest_stable are uploaded nightly depending if the OpenRAVE trunk passes all tests. Old files are kept for a maximum of 7 days.
