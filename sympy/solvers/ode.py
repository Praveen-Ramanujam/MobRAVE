This module contains dsolve() and different helper functions that it
uses.

dsolve() solves ordinary differential equations. See the docstring on
the various functions for their uses. Note that partial differential
equations support is in pde.py.  Note that ode_hint() functions have
docstrings describing their various methods, but they are intended for
internal use.  Use dsolve(ode, func, hint=hint) to solve an ode using a
specific hint.  See also the docstring on dsolve().

**Functions in this module**

    These are the user functions in this module:

    - dsolve() - Solves ODEs.
    - classify_ode() - Classifies ODEs into possible hints for dsolve().
    - checkodesol() - Checks if an equation is the solution to an ODE.
    - ode_order() - Returns the order (degree) of an ODE.
    - homogeneous_order() - Returns the homogeneous order of an
      expression.

    See also the docstrings of these functions.  There are also quite a
    few functions that are not imported into the global namespace. See
    the docstrings of those functions for more info.

**Solving methods currently implemented**

The following methods are implemented for solving ordinary differential
equations.  See the docstrings of the various ode_hint() functions for
more information on each (run help(ode)):
    - 1st order separable differential equations
    - 1st order differential equations whose coefficients or dx and dy
      are functions homogeneous of the same order.
    - 1st order exact differential equations.
    - 1st order linear differential equations
    - 1st order Bernoulli differential equations.
    - 2nd order Liouville differential equations.
    - nth order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant
      coefficients.
    - nth order linear inhomogeneous differential equation with constant
      coefficients using the method of undetermined coefficients.
    - nth order linear inhomogeneous differential equation with constant
      coefficients using the method of variation of parameters.

**Philosophy behind this module**

This module is designed to make it easy to add new ODE solving methods
without having to mess with the solving code for other methods.  The
idea is that there is a classify_ode() function, which takes in an ODE
and tells you what hints, if any, will solve the ODE.  It does this
without attempting to solve the ODE, so it is fast.  Each solving method
is a hint, and it has its own function, named ode_hint.  That function
takes in the ODE and any match expression gathered by classify_ode and
returns a solved result.  If this result has any integrals in it, the
ode_hint function will return an unevaluated Integral class. dsolve(),
which is the user wrapper function around all of this, will then call
odesimp() on the result, which, among other things, will attempt to
solve the equation for the dependent variable (the function we are
solving for), simplify the arbitrary constants in the expression, and
evaluate any integrals, if the hint allows it.

**How to add new solution methods**

If you have an ODE that you want dsolve() to be able to solve, try to
avoid adding special case code here.  Instead, try finding a general
method that will solve your ODE, as well as others.  This way, the ode
module will become more robust, and unhindered by special case hacks.
WolphramAlpha and Maple's DETools[odeadvisor] function are two resources
you can use to classify a specific ODE.  It is also better for a method
to work with an nth order ODE instead of only with specific orders, if
possible.

To add a new method, there are a few things that you need to do.  First,
you need a hint name for your method.  Try to name your hint so that it
is unambiguous with all other methods, including ones that may not be
implemented yet.  If your method uses integrals, also include a
"hint_Integral" hint.  If there is more than one way to solve ODEs with
your method, include a hint for each one, as well as a "hint_best" hint.
Your ode_hint_best() function should choose the best using
compare_ode_sol.  See ode_1st_homogeneous_coeff_best(), for example. The
function that uses your method will be called ode_hint(), so the hint
must only use characters that are allowed in a Python function name
(alphanumeric characters and the underscore '_' character).  Include a
function for every hint, except for "_Integral" hints (dsolve() takes
care of those automatically).  Hint names should be all lowercase,
unless a word is commonly capitalized (such as Integral or Bernoulli).
If you have a hint that you do not want to run with "all_Integral" that
doesn't have an "_Integral" counterpart (such as a best hint that would
defeat the purpose of "all_Integral"), you will need to remove it
manually in the dsolve() code.  See also the classify_ode() docstring
for guidelines on writing a hint name.

Determine **in general** how the solutions returned by your method
compare with other methods that can potentially solve the same ODEs.
Then, put your hints in the allhints tuple in the order that they should
be called.  The ordering of this tuple determines which hints are
default. Note that exceptions are ok, because it is easy for the user to
choose individual hints with dsolve().  In general, "_Integral" variants
should go at the end of the list, and "_best" variants should go before
the various hints they apply to.  For example, the
"undetermined_coefficients" hint comes before the
"variation_of_parameters" hint because, even though variation of
parameters is more general than undetermined coefficients, undetermined
coefficients generally returns cleaner results for the ODEs that it can
solve than variation of parameters does, and it does not require
integration, so it is much faster.

Next, you need to have a match expression or a function that matches the
type of the ODE, which you should put in classify_ode() (if the match
function is more than just a few lines, like
_undetermined_coefficients_match(), it should go outside of
classify_ode()).  It should match the ODE without solving for it as much
as possible, so that classify_ode() remains fast and is not hindered by
bugs in solving code.  Be sure to consider corner cases. For example, if
your solution method involves dividing by something, make sure you
exclude the case where that division will be 0.

In most cases, the matching of the ODE will also give you the various
parts that you need to solve it. You should put that in a dictionary
(.match() will do this for you), and add that as matching_hints['hint']
= matchdict in the relevant part of classify_ode.  classify_ode will
then send this to dsolve(), which will send it to your function as the
match argument. Your function should be named ode_hint(eq, func, order,
match). If you need to send more information, put it in the match
dictionary.  For example, if you had to substitute in a dummy variable
in classify_ode to match the ODE, you will need to pass it to your
function using the match dict to access it.  You can access the
independent variable using func.args[0], and the dependent variable (the
function you are trying to solve for) as func.func.  If, while trying to
solve the ODE, you find that you cannot, raise NotImplementedError.
dsolve() will catch this error with the "all" meta-hint, rather than
causing the whole routine to fail.

Add a docstring to your function that describes the method employed.
Like with anything else in SymPy, you will need to add a doctest to the
docstring, in addition to real tests in test_ode.py.  Try to maintain
consistency with the other hint functions' docstrings.  Add your method
to the list at the top of this docstring.  Also, add your method to
ode.txt in the docs/src directory, so that the Sphinx docs will pull its
docstring into the main SymPy documentation.  Be sure to make the Sphinx
documentation by running "make html" from within the doc directory to
verify that the docstring formats correctly.

If your solution method involves integrating, use C.Integral() instead
of integrate().  This allows the user to bypass hard/slow integration by
using the "_Integral" variant of your hint.  In most cases, calling
.doit() will integrate your solution.  If this is not the case, you will
need to write special code in _handle_Integral().  Arbitrary constants
should be symbols named C1, C2, and so on.  All solution methods should
return an equality instance.  If you need an arbitrary number of
arbitrary constants, you can use constants =
numbered_symbols(prefix='C', function=Symbol, start=1).  If it is
possible to solve for the dependent function in a general way, do so.
Otherwise, do as best as you can, but do not call solve in your
ode_hint() function.  odesimp() will attempt to solve the solution for
you, so you do not need to do that. Lastly, if your ODE has a common
simplification that can be applied to your solutions, you can add a
special case in odesimp() for it.  For example, solutions returned from
the "1st_homogeneous_coeff" hints often have many log() terms, so
odesimp() calls logcombine() on them (it also helps to write the
arbitrary constant as log(C1) instead of C1 in this case).  Also
consider common ways that you can rearrange your solution to have
constantsimp() take better advantage of it.  It is better to put
simplification in odesimp() than in your method, because it can then be
turned off with the simplify flag in dsolve(). If you have any
extraneous simplification in your function, be sure to only run it using
"if match.get('simplify', True):", especially if it can be slow or if it
can reduce the domain of the solution.

Finally, as with every contribution to SymPy, your method will need to
be tested. Add a test for each method in test_ode.py.  Follow the
conventions there, i.e., test the solver using dsolve(eq, f(x),
hint=your_hint), and also test the solution using checkodesol (you can
put these in a separate tests and skip/XFAIL if it runs too slow/doesn't
work).  Be sure to call your hint specifically in dsolve, that way the
test won't be broken simply by the introduction of another matching
hint. If your method works for higher order (>1) ODEs, you will need to
run sol = ode_renumber(sol, 'C', 1, order), for each solution, where
order is the order of the ODE. This is because ode_renumber renumbers
the arbitrary constants by printing order, which is platform dependent.
Try to test every corner case of your solver, including a range of
orders if it is a nth order solver, but if your solver is slow, auch as
if it involves hard integration, try to keep the test run time down.

Feel free to refactor existing hints to avoid duplicating code or
creating inconsistencies.  If you can show that your method exactly
duplicates an existing method, including in the simplicity and speed of
obtaining the solutions, then you can remove the old, less general
method. The existing code is tested extensively in test_ode.py, so if
anything is broken, one of those tests will surely fail.

def dsolve(eq, func, hint="default", simplify=True, **kwargs):
    """
    Solves any (supported) kind of ordinary differential equation.

    **Usage**

        dsolve(eq, f(x), hint) -> Solve ordinary differential equation
        eq for function f(x), using method hint.


    **Details**

        ``eq`` can be any supported ordinary differential equation (see
            the ode docstring for supported methods).  This can either
            be an Equality, or an expression, which is assumed to be
            equal to 0.

        ``f(x)`` is a function of one variable whose derivatives in that
            variable make up the ordinary differential equation eq.

        ``hint`` is the solving method that you want dsolve to use.  Use
            classify_ode(eq, f(x)) to get all of the possible hints for
            an ODE.  The default hint, 'default', will use whatever hint
            is returned first by classify_ode().  See Hints below for
            more options that you can use for hint.
        ``simplify`` enables simplification by odesimp().  See its
            docstring for more information.  Turn this off, for example,
            to disable solving of solutions for func or simplification
            of arbitrary constants.  It will still integrate with this
            hint. Note that the solution may contain more arbitrary
            constants than the order of the ODE with this option
            enabled.

    **Hints**

        Aside from the various solving methods, there are also some
        meta-hints that you can pass to dsolve():

        "default":
                This uses whatever hint is returned first by
                classify_ode(). This is the default argument to
                dsolve().

        "all":
                To make dsolve apply all relevant classification hints,
                use dsolve(ODE, func, hint="all").  This will return a
                dictionary of hint:solution terms.  If a hint causes
                dsolve to raise NotImplementedError, value of that
                hint's key will be the exception object raised.  The
                dictionary will also include some special keys:

                - order: The order of the ODE.  See also ode_order().
                - best: The simplest hint; what would be returned by
                  "best" below.
                - best_hint: The hint that would produce the solution
                  given by 'best'.  If more than one hint produces the
                  best solution, the first one in the tuple returned by
                  classify_ode() is chosen.
                - default: The solution that would be returned by
                  default.  This is the one produced by the hint that
                  appears first in the tuple returned by classify_ode().

        "all_Integral":
                This is the same as "all", except if a hint also has a
                corresponding "_Integral" hint, it only returns the
                "_Integral" hint.  This is useful if "all" causes
                dsolve() to hang because of a difficult or impossible
                integral.  This meta-hint will also be much faster than
                "all", because integrate() is an expensive routine.

        "best":
                To have dsolve() try all methods and return the simplest
                one.  This takes into account whether the solution is
                solvable in the function, whether it contains any
                Integral classes (i.e. unevaluatable integrals), and
                which one is the shortest in size.

        See also the classify_ode() docstring for more info on hints,
        and the ode docstring for a list of all supported hints.


    **Tips**
        - You can declare the derivative of an unknown function this way:
            >>> from sympy import Function, Derivative
            >>> from sympy.abc import x # x is the independent variable
            >>> f = Function("f")(x) # f is a function of x
            >>> # f_ will be the derivative of f with respect to x
            >>> f_ = Derivative(f, x)

        - See test_ode.py for many tests, which serves also as a set of
          examples for how to use dsolve().
        - dsolve always returns an Equality class (except for the case
          when the hint is "all" or "all_Integral").  If possible, it
          solves the solution explicitly for the function being solved
          for. Otherwise, it returns an implicit solution.
        - Arbitrary constants are symbols named C1, C2, and so on.
        - Because all solutions should be mathematically equivalent,
          some hints may return the exact same result for an ODE. Often,
          though, two different hints will return the same solution
          formatted differently.  The two should be equivalent. Also
          note that sometimes the values of the arbitrary constants in
          two different solutions may not be the same, because one
          constant may have "absorbed" other constants into it.
        - Do help(ode.ode_hintname) to get help more information on a
          specific hint, where hintname is the name of a hint without
          "_Integral".

    **Examples**

        >>> from sympy import Function, dsolve, Eq, Derivative, sin, cos
        >>> from sympy.abc import x
        >>> f = Function('f')
        >>> dsolve(Derivative(f(x),x,x)+9*f(x), f(x))
        f(x) == C1*sin(3*x) + C2*cos(3*x)
        >>> dsolve(sin(x)*cos(f(x)) + cos(x)*sin(f(x))*f(x).diff(x), f(x),
        ...     hint='separable')
        -log(1 - sin(f(x))**2)/2 == C1 + log(1 - sin(x)**2)/2
        >>> dsolve(sin(x)*cos(f(x)) + cos(x)*sin(f(x))*f(x).diff(x), f(x),
        ...     hint='1st_exact')
        f(x) == acos(C1/cos(x))
        >>> dsolve(sin(x)*cos(f(x)) + cos(x)*sin(f(x))*f(x).diff(x), f(x),
        ... hint='best')
        f(x) == acos(C1/cos(x))
        >>> # Note that even though separable is the default, 1st_exact produces
        >>> # a simpler result in this case.

    Returns a tuple of possible dsolve() classifications for an ODE.

    The tuple is ordered so that first item is the classification that
    dsolve() uses to solve the ODE by default.  In general,
    classifications at the near the beginning of the list will produce
    better solutions faster than those near the end, thought there are

    use dsolve(ODE, func, hint=<classification>).  See also the dsolve()

    If dict is true, classify_ode() will return a dictionary of
    hint:match expression terms. This is intended for internal use by
    dsolve().  Note that because dictionaries are ordered arbitrarily,
    this will most likely not be in the same order as the tuple.

    You can get help on different hints by doing help(ode.ode_hintname),
    where hintname is the name of the hint without "_Integral".

    See sympy.ode.allhints or the sympy.ode docstring for a list of all
    supported hints that can be returned from classify_ode.

    **Notes on Hint Names**

    *"_Integral"*

        If a classification has "_Integral" at the end, it will return
        the expression with an unevaluated Integral class in it.  Note
        that a hint may do this anyway if integrate() cannot do the
        integral, though just using an "_Integral" will do so much
        faster.  Indeed, an "_Integral" hint will always be faster than
        its corresponding hint without "_Integral" because integrate()
        is an expensive routine.  If dsolve() hangs, it is probably
        because integrate() is hanging on a tough or impossible
        integral.  Try using an "_Integral" hint or "all_Integral" to
        get it return something.

        Note that some hints do not have "_Integral" counterparts.  This
        is because integrate() is not used in solving the ODE for those
        method. For example, nth order linear homogeneous ODEs with
        constant coefficients do not require integration to solve, so
        there is no "nth_linear_homogeneous_constant_coeff_Integrate"
        hint. You can easily evaluate any unevaluated Integrals in an
        expression by doing expr.doit().

    *Ordinals*

        Some hints contain an ordinal such as "1st_linear".  This is to
        help differentiate them from other hints, as well as from other
        methods that may not be implemented yet. If a hint has "nth" in
        it, such as the "nth_linear" hints, this means that the method
        used to applies to ODEs of any order.

    *"indep" and "dep"*

        Some hints contain the words "indep" or "dep".  These reference
        the independent variable and the dependent function,
        respectively. For example, if an ODE is in terms of f(x), then
        "indep" will refer to x and "dep" will refer to f.

    *"subs"*

        If a hints has the word "subs" in it, it means the the ODE is
        solved by substituting the expression given after the word
        "subs" for a single dummy variable.  This is usually in terms of
        "indep" and "dep" as above.  The substituted expression will be
        written only in characters allowed for names of Python objects,
        meaning operators will be spelled out.  For example, indep/dep
        will be written as indep_div_dep.

    *"coeff"*

        The word "coeff" in a hint refers to the coefficients of
        something in the ODE, usually of the derivative terms.  See the
        docstring for the individual methods for more info (help(ode)).
        This is contrast to "coefficients", as in
        "undetermined_coefficients", which refers to the common name of
        a method.

    *"_best"*

        Methods that have more than one fundamental way to solve will
        have a hint for each sub-method and a "_best"
        meta-classification. This will evaluate all hints and return the
        best, using the same considerations as the normal "best"
        meta-hint.

    r"""
    Simplifies ODEs, including trying to solve for func and running
    constantsimp().

    It may use knowledge of the type of solution that that hint returns
    to apply additional simplifications.

    It also attempts to integrate any Integrals in the expression, if
    the hint is not an "_Integral" hint.

    This function should have no effect on expressions returned by
    dsolve(), as dsolve already calls odesimp(), but the individual hint
    functions do not call odesimp (because the dsolve() wrapper does).
    Therefore, this function is designed for mainly internal use.

    Substitutes sol for func in ode and checks that the result is 0.

    This only works when func is one function, like f(x).  sol can be a
    single solution or a list of solutions.  Either way, each solution
    must be an Equality instance (e.g., Eq(f(x), C1*cos(x) +
    C2*sin(x))).  If it is a list of solutions, it will return a list of
    the checkodesol() result for each solution.

    It tries the following methods, in order, until it finds zero
    equivalence:

        1. Substitute the solution for f in the original equation.  This
           only works if the ode is solved for f.  It will attempt to solve
           it first unless solve_for_func == False
        2. Take n derivatives of the solution, where n is the order of
           ode, and check to see if that is equal to the solution.  This
           only works on exact odes.
        3. Take the 1st, 2nd, ..., nth derivatives of the solution, each
           time solving for the derivative of f of that order (this will
           always be possible because f is a linear operator).  Then back
           substitute each derivative into ode in reverse order.

    This function returns a tuple.  The first item in the tuple is True
    if the substitution results in 0, and False otherwise. The second
    item in the tuple is what the substitution results in.  It should
    always be 0 if the first item is True. Note that sometimes this
    function will False, but with an expression that is identically
    equal to 0, instead of returning True.  This is because simplify()
    cannot reduce the expression to 0.  If an expression returned by
    this function vanishes identically, then sol really is a solution to
    ode.

    If this function seems to hang, it is probably because of a hard
    simplification.

    To use this function to test, test the first item of the tuple.

    This works like a standard Python cmp function, for use with

    from a list, you can use:

    sorted(listofodes, cmp=lambda x, y: compare_ode_sol(x, y, func))[0]

def constantsimp(expr, independentsymbol, endnumber, startnumber=1,

    """
    Simplifies an expression with arbitrary constants in it.

    This function is written specifically to work with dsolve(), and is
    not intended for general use.

    Simplification is done by "absorbing" the arbitrary constants in to
    other arbitrary constants, numbers, and symbols that they are not
    independent of.

    The symbols must all have the same name with numbers after it, for
    example, C1, C2, C3.  The symbolname here would be 'C', the
    startnumber would be 1, and the end number would be 3.  If the
    arbitrary constants are independent of the variable x, then the
    independent symbol would be x.  There is no need to specify the
    dependent function, such as f(x), because it already has the
    independent symbol, x, in it.

    Because terms are "absorbed" into arbitrary constants and because
    constants are renumbered after simplifying, the arbitrary constants
    in expr are not necessarily equal to the ones of the same name in
    the returned result.

    If two or more arbitrary constants are added, multiplied, or raised
    to the power of each other, they are first absorbed together into a
    single arbitrary constant.  Then the new constant is combined into
    other terms if necessary.

    Absorption is done naively.  constantsimp() does not attempt to
    expand or simplify the expression first to obtain better absorption.
    So for example, exp(C1)*exp(x) will be simplified to C1*exp(x), but
    exp(C1 + x) will be left alone.

    Use ode_renumber() to renumber constants after simplification.
    Without using that function, simplified constants may end up
    having any numbering to them.

    In rare cases, a single constant can be "simplified" into two
    constants.  Every differential equation solution should have as many
    arbitrary constants as the order of the differential equation.  The
    result here will be technically correct, but it may, for example,
    have C1 and C2 in an expression, when C1 is actually equal to C2.
    Use your discretion in such situations, and also take advantage of
    the ability to use hints in dsolve().

    Solves 1st order exact ordinary differential equations.

    A 1st order differential equation is called exact if it is the total
    differential of a function. That is, the differential equation
    P(x, y)dx + Q(x, y)dy = 0 is exact if there is some function F(x, y)
    such that P(x, y) = dF/dx and Q(x, y) = dF/dy (d here refers to the
    partial derivative).  It can be shown that a necessary and
    sufficient condition for a first order ODE to be exact is that
    dP/dy = dQ/dx.  Then, the solution will be as given below::

        >>> from sympy import Function, Eq, Integral, symbols, pprint

    Where the first partials of P and Q exist and are continuous in a
    simply connected region.

    A note: SymPy currently has no way to represent inert substitution on
    an expression, so the hint '1st_exact_Integral' will return an integral
    with dy.  This is supposed to represent the function that you are
    solving for.

    Solves an nth order linear homogeneous differential equation with

    This is an equation of the form a_n*f(x)^(n) + a_(n-1)*f(x)^(n-1) +
    ... + a1*f'(x) + a0*f(x) = 0

    These equations can be solved in a general manner, by taking the
    roots of the characteristic equation a_n*m**n + a_(n-1)*m**(n-1) +
    ... + a1*m + a0 = 0.  The solution will then be the sum of
    Cn*x**i*exp(r*x) terms, for each  where Cn is an arbitrary constant,
    r is a root of the characteristic equation and i is is one of each
    from 0 to the multiplicity of the root - 1 (for example, a root 3 of
    multiplicity 2 would create the terms C1*exp(3*x) + C2*x*exp(3*x)).
    The exponential is usually expanded for complex roots using Euler's
    equation exp(I*x) = cos(x) + I*sin(x).  Complex roots always come in
    conjugate pars in polynomials with real coefficients, so the two
    roots will be represented (after simplifying the constants) as
    exp(a*x)*(C1*cos(b*x) + C2*sin(b*x)).

    If SymPy cannot find exact roots to the characteristic equation, a
    RootOf instance will be return in its stead.

    Note that because this method does not involve integration, there is
    no 'nth_linear_constant_coeff_homogeneous_Integral' hint.

    The following is for internal use:

    returns = 'sol' returns the solution to the ODE.
    returns = 'list'  returns a list of linearly independent solutions,
    for use with non homogeneous solution methods like variation of
    parameters and undetermined coefficients.  Note that, though the
    solutions should be linearly independent, this function does not
    explicitly check that.  You can do "assert
    simplify(wronskian(sollist)) != 0" to check for linear independence.
     Also, "assert len(sollist) == order" will need to pass.
     returns = 'both', return a dictionary {'sol':solution to ODE,

def ode_nth_linear_constant_coeff_undetermined_coefficients(eq, func, order, match):
    r"""
    Solves an nth order linear differential equation with constant
    coefficients using the method of undetermined coefficients.

    This method works on differential equations of the form a_n*f(x)^(n)
    + a_(n-1)*f(x)^(n-1) + ... + a1*f'(x) + a0*f(x) = P(x), where P(x)
    is a function that has a finite number of linearly independent
    derivatives.

    Functions that fit this requirement are finite sums functions of the
    form a*x**i*exp(b*x)*sin(c*x + d) or a*x**i*exp(b*x)*cos(c*x + d),
    where i is a non-negative integer and a, b, c, and d are constants.
    For example any polynomial in x, functions like x**2*exp(2*x),
    x*sin(x), and exp(x)*cos(x) can all be used.  Products of sin's and
    cos's have a finite number of derivatives, because they can be
    expanded into sin(a*x) and cos(b*x) terms.  However, SymPy currently
    cannot do that expansion, so you will need to manually rewrite the
    expression in terms of the above to use this method.  So, for example,
    you will need to manually convert sin(x)**2 into (1 + cos(2*x))/2 to
    properly apply the method of undetermined coefficients on it.

    This method works by creating a trial function from the expression
    and all of its linear independent derivatives and substituting them
    into the original ODE.  The coefficients for each term will be a
    system of linear equations, which are be solved for and substituted,
    giving the solution.  If any of the trial functions are linearly
    dependent on the solution to the homogeneous equation, they are
    multiplied by sufficient x to make them linearly independent.

    **Example**
        >>> from sympy import Function, dsolve, pprint, exp, cos
        >>> from sympy.abc import x
        >>> f = Function('f')
        >>> pprint(dsolve(f(x).diff(x, 2) + 2*f(x).diff(x) + f(x) -

def ode_nth_linear_constant_coeff_variation_of_parameters(eq, func, order, match):
    r"""
    Solves an nth order linear differential equation with constant
    coefficients using the method of undetermined coefficients.

    This method works on any differential equations of the form
    f(x)^(n) + a_(n-1)*f(x)^(n-1) + ... + a1*f'(x) + a0*f(x) = P(x).

    This method works by assuming that the particular solution takes the
    form Sum(c_i(x)*y_i(x), (x, 1, n)), where y_i is the ith solution to
    the homogeneous equation.  The solution is then solved using
    Wronskian's and Cramer's Rule.  The particular solution is given by
    Sum(Integral(W_i(x)/W(x), x)*y_i(x), (x, 1, n)), where W(x) is the
    Wronskian of the fundamental system (the system of n linearly
    independent solutions to the homogeneous equation), and W_i(x) is
    the Wronskian of the fundamental system with the ith column replaced
    with [0, 0, ..., 0, P(x)].

    This method is general enough to solve any nth order inhomogeneous
    linear differential equation with constant coefficients, but
    sometimes SymPy cannot simplify the Wronskian well enough to
    integrate it.  If this method hangs, try using the
    'nth_linear_constant_coeff_variation_of_parameters_Integral' hint
    and simplifying the integrals manually.  Also, prefer using
    'nth_linear_constant_coeff_undetermined_coefficients' when it
    applies, because it doesn't use integration, making it faster and
    more reliable.

    Warning, using simplify=False with
    'nth_linear_constant_coeff_variation_of_parameters' in dsolve()
    may cause it to hang, because it will not attempt to simplify
    the Wronskian before integrating.  It is recommended that you only
    use simplify=False with
    'nth_linear_constant_coeff_variation_of_parameters_Integral' for
    this method, especially if the solution to the homogeneous
    equation has trigonometric functions in it.

    r"""
    Solves separable 1st order differential equations.

    This is any differential equation that can be written as
    P(y)*dy/dx = Q(x). The solution can then just be found by
    rearranging terms and integrating:
    Integral(P(y), y) = Integral(Q(x), x). This hint uses separatevars()
    as its back end, so if a separable equation is not caught by this
    solver, it is most likely the fault of that function. seperatevars()
    is smart enough to do most expansion and factoring necessary to
    convert a separable equation F(x, y) into the proper form P(x)*Q(y).
    The general solution is::

        >>> from sympy import Function, dsolve, Eq, pprint
        >>> from sympy.abc import x
        >>> a, b, c, d, f = map(Function, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f'])
        >>> pprint(dsolve(Eq(a(x)*b(f(x))*f(x).diff(x), c(x)*d(f(x))), f(x),
        ... hint='separable_Integral'))
             f(x)
           /                  /
          |                  |
          |  b(y)            | c(x)
          |  ---- dy = C1 +  | ---- dx
          |  d(y)            | a(x)
          |                  |
         /                  /

        >>> from sympy.abc import x
        >>> f = Function('f')
        >>> pprint(dsolve(Eq(f(x)*f(x).diff(x) + x, 3*x*f(x)**2), f(x),
        ... hint='separable'))
